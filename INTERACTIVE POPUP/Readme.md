1. Here I have learnt:
   1. How to attach .JS to a Popup
   2. How to handle click button.
   3. How popup scripts work (isolated from web pages)
2. Drawbacks:
   1. There is no Storage. 
   2. Every popup is like a fresh tab thatâ€™s created and destroyed each time I click the icon. 
   3. When I close the popup, its JS memory is wiped.
